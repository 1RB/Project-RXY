    <h1>Welcome to our Language Information Site</h1>
    <p>There are approximately 7,000 languages currently spoken around the world.</p>
    <p>The most widely spoken languages are Mandarin, Spanish, English, and Hindi.</p>
    <p>Some languages, like Basque and Ainu, are language isolates, meaning they have no known linguistic relatives.</p>
    <h2>Categories of Languages</h2>
    <p>There are several ways to categorize languages. One common method is by family, which groups languages by their historical relations. For example, English and German are both part of the Indo-European language family.</p>
    <p>Another way to categorize languages is by their grammatical features. For instance, some languages are classified as agglutinative, meaning they use a lot of affixes, while others are isolating, meaning they tend to use separate words instead of affixes.</p>
    <p>Languages can also be categorized by their writing systems, such as alphabetic (like English), syllabic (like Japanese), or logographic (like Chinese).</p>
